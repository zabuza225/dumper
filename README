## Installation
### Composer
```
composer require bajankristof/dumper
```

### Manual
Just download the `src` directory and `require` the provided `autoload.php` file.

## Usage
As simple as calling `dump(...)` or `dd(...)`, just like `var_dump(...)` though the results will be different... See for yourself :smirk:

## Styles
To change the looks of the dump just go ahead and edit the `dump.css` file. (Be aware though that this might get overwritten by a `composer update`.)
